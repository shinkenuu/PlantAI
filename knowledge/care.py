    "spathiphyllum wallisii": {
        "watering": "Peace Lilies should be watered deeply and thoroughly, about once a week. Water until it begins to flow from the bottom of the pot, then stop. Allow the soil to dry out completely between watering, as too much water can cause root rot. This species is relatively tolerant of drier soil, so be sure to allow the top inch of soil to become dry before watering again.",
        "sunlight": "Peace lilies thrive best with bright, indirect sunlight. Generally, these plants should be placed in a room or area that receives some sunlight, preferably 2 to 4 hours during the morning or afternoon. Placing the plant too close to a window or in too much direct sunlight can cause burning of the leaves. If the plant is not receiving enough sunlight, its leaves may become limp and yellow.",
        "pruning": "Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) generally do not require regular pruning, but if it becomes necessary to shape the plant or encourage new growth, it can be done throughout the year. Prune spathes that have already released their flowers to encourage new blooms. In addition, you can prune any old foliage that gets yellow or brown. Cut any of these leaves off near the base of the plant using scissors or small garden shears. Depending on your plants needs, you may want to consider doing light pruning once or twice per year, as this can help promote bushier, healthier plants. Be sure to use clean scissors and shears when pruning, and sterilize them between pruning sessions to avoid spreading any diseases.",

    "hedera helix": {
        "watering": "English ivy should be watered about twice a week during summer and once a week in winter. You should water the plant until the soil is evenly moist, but not soggy. English ivy does well in humid environments, so you may want to mist it regularly and use a pot with drainage holes or water-retaining material at its base to maintain humidity.",
        "sunlight": "English ivy, also known as Hedera helix, prefers partial to full shade and no more than 3 hours of direct sunlight a day. Generally, mornings hours of direct sun are best, as the intensity of the light is lower. Too much direct sunlight can cause the leaves to yellow or brown and suffer sun damage, which can lead to an overall decline in the health of the plant. English ivy should be placed in an area of the garden that is receives dappled sunlight or filtered sun throughout the day.",
        "pruning": "English ivy should be pruned twice a year - once in the spring and once in the fall. Prune English ivy to remove any dead or damaged portions of the plant, and to maintain the desired shape and size. Pruning should focus on removing overgrown or unwanted foliage, shoots, and tendrils. To prune, use sharp garden shears, and cut the foliage back to the desired size. Pruning should be done lightly, since too much pruning can damage the plant's health. For best results, prune English ivy after it has finished blooming in the spring and just before the first frost of the fall.",
    },
    "dieffenbachia seguine": {
        "watering": "Water Dumb Cane plants lightly, about once per week, providing enough moisture to keep the soil lightly moist. Reduce watering to once every 2 weeks if the leaves start to discolor or feel limp. Avoid overwatering as this can lead to root rot. Water Dumb Cane when the soil becomes dry to the touch. Feel the soil 1 to 2 inches below the surface before deciding whether or not the plant needs water.",
        "sunlight": "Dumb cane (Dieffenbachia seguine) prefers bright, indirect sunlight. The best way to achieve this is for the plant to receive 4\u20136 hours of sunlight each day. It is important to avoid direct sunlight, as the plant may become scorched. For best results, you should move the Dieffenbachia seguine to an area with indirect sunlight in the morning and another area with indirect sunlight in the afternoon.",
        "pruning": "Dumb cane (Dieffenbachia seguine) should be pruned in late spring or early summer. Generally, pruning should be kept to a minimum. As long as the plant is healthy, you only need to remove dead or damaged foliage. If you want to control the size of your plant, you can prune stems or shoots back by around a third of their length. Always sterilize your pruning tools before use to prevent any bacterial infection of your plant.",
    },
    "epipremnum aureum": {
        "watering": "Golden Pothos plants should be watered when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Depending on the temperature and light of the location where the pothos is placed, it should be watered anywhere from once every 5-7 days to once a week. A general rule of thumb is to give it a good, deep watering, allowing all the excess water to freely drain out the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil to dry out partially between waterings. Too much water can cause the roots of the plant to rot, while too little water can cause the foliage to turn brown.",
        "sunlight": "The golden pothos plant, also called Epipremnum aureum, is an evergreen vine that requires medium light, which means it needs to receive a few hours of direct sunlight each day. The golden pothos prefers its light to be indirect and bright. This can be achieved by providing the plant with early morning sunlight, which is the best source of light that maintains a healthy plant. When providing direct sun, the recommended amount of time should not exceed 4 to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
        "pruning": "Golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum) prefer little pruning and should only be pruned if parts of the plant are overly long or overgrown. The best time to prune golden pothos is in the spring. Pruning can be done in 2 ways. First, gently pinch off the end of the tips of the stems. This will help to promote bushiness and encourage the plant to branch out. Second, prune off any dead or damaged stems. Only remove a small amount of the stems at a time, since drastic pruning can shock the plant and slow down growth. Pruning should be kept to a minimum so that the plant can stay healthy and lush.",
    },
    "tillandsia cyanea": {
        "watering": "Tillandsia cyanea doesn't need a lot of watering. The best way to water yours is to spray it once or twice a week, depending on how dry your conditions are. You can give the growing medium a good drink every 1-3 months, depending on the temperatures and the season. Like all houseplants, water less in the late fall/winter months. If your water is hard, then use purified or distilled water as this plant is susceptible to a build up of minerals in some tap waters.",
        "sunlight": "Good, bright natural light is best for you Pink Quill Plant. An east or west exposure fits that bill. You want it in this light to bring on the flowering & keep the plant happy for the long run. Be sure to avoid any strong, direct sun as the plant will burn.",
        "pruning": "The optimal pruning time is early spring, aligning with its growth cycle. Remove any dried, damaged, or wilting leaves by cutting them at the base. This encourages healthy new growth and prevents disease. Regular pruning enhances air circulation and aesthetics. Ensure tools are sterilized to avoid infections",
    },
    "saintpaulia ionantha": {
        "watering": "African violets should be watered once every 5-7 days, depending on the local conditions such as humidity and temperature. Watering for African violets should be deep and thorough but take care not to overwater. The size of the pot and type of potting medium also affect the amount of water needed. About 3 tablespoons of water per plant is recommended, but this may need to be adjusted depending on the size of the pot and the potting medium.",
        "sunlight": "African Violets require low-to-medium indirect sunlight for optimal growth and flowering. They do best with 4-6 hours of bright, indirect sunlight each day, through a lightly curtained window or other indirect light source. Avoid direct sunlight, as this could cause the delicate leaves to burn. If the African Violet gets too little light, it will not bloom. However, too much direct sunlight can cause the leaves to wilt or turn yellow and can cause burning of the petals.",
        "pruning": "African violets (Saintpaulia ionantha) should be pruned regularly throughout the season, but typically no more than once a month. Prune off dead or dying leaves and flowers to promote healthy new foliage and blooms. Begin pruning in late winter or early spring, just before new growth appears.",
