Then, I would reach out to friends or loved ones and make plans to spend time together, whether it's grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or simply having a conversation. Additionally, I would explore new hobbies or activities that interest me, joining clubs or groups where I can meet like-minded individuals. Lastly, I would remind myself that it's okay to be alone sometimes and use that time for self-reflection, self-care, and personal growth.\""
